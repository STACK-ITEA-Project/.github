## STACK Project
The goal of STACK is to let IoT networks maintain their functionality in both benign environments and more challenging situations, 
such as when IoT networks are under attack or exposed to harsh radio environments and cross-technology interference. 
Solving these challenges will enable a new class of IoT applications that provide a certain Quality of Service (QoS), 
even when under attack. Our major innovations towards this goal include more robust IoT communication, attack detection 
and mitigation by performance and interference monitoring and smart algorithms that leverage a tight integration of IoT
devices with a smart edge.
